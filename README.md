# Temperature-Converter
I completed this project as my 2nd task in BharatIntern internship. (Web development)

Overview:

      Temperature is measured using a thermometer. A temperature converter helps to convert the temperature among different scales. 

This website is built using #html, #css and #javascript and has three temperature scales which are inter-convertable:

ğŸ”¸'Celcius' scale

ğŸ”¸'Fairenheit' scale

ğŸ”¸'Kelvin' scale
